**bit_gossip**, named after its implementation technique, is a simple pathfinding library for calculating all node pairs' shortest paths in an unweighted undirected graph.

Once the computation is complete, you can retrieve the shortest path between any two nodes in near constant time; I'm talking less than a microsecond!

This library is for you if your game:

- has decent number of nodes/tiles (~1000), and
- has hundreds or thousands of entities that need to find paths to a moving target.

If you have a static map of large number of nodes (>10,000),
you can use this library to compute all paths during the loading phase.

Also, computation is fast enough to be used not only in static maps but also in dynamically changing maps in games.

- Computing all paths for 100 nodes takes only a few hundred Âµs on a modern CPU.
- Computing all paths for 1000 nodes takes less than 50 ms on a modern CPU.
- Computing all paths for 10000 nodes takes less a few seconds.

See [benchmarks](#benchmarks) for more details.

## Basic Usage

### Small Graphs

For small graphs with less than 128 nodes, use [Graph16], [Graph32], [Graph64], or [Graph128].

In GraphN, like `Graph16`, N denotes the number of nodes that the graph can hold.

```sh
0 -- 1 -- 2 -- 3
|         |    |
4 -- 5 -- 6 -- 7
|         |    |
8 -- 9 -- 10 - 11
```

```rust
use bit_gossip::Graph16;

// Initialize a builder with 12 nodes
let mut builder = Graph16::builder(12);

// Connect the nodes
for i in 0..12u8 {
    if i % 4 != 3 {
        builder.connect(i, i + 1);
    }
    if i < 8 {
        builder.connect(i, i + 4);
    }
}

builder.disconnect(1, 5);
builder.disconnect(5, 9);

// Build the graph
let graph = builder.build();

// Check the shortest path from 0 to 9
assert_eq!(graph.neighbor_to(0, 9), Some(4));
assert_eq!(graph.neighbor_to(4, 9), Some(8));
assert_eq!(graph.neighbor_to(8, 9), Some(9));

// Both 1 and 4 can reach 11 in the shortest path.
assert_eq!(graph.neighbors_to(0, 11).collect::<Vec<_>>(), vec![1, 4]);

// Get the path from 0 to 5
assert_eq!(graph.path_to(0, 5).collect::<Vec<_>>(), vec![0, 4, 5]);
```

### Large Graphs

For graphs with more than 128 nodes, use [Graph], which can hold arbitrary number of nodes.

If the environment allows multi-threading, `Graph` will process paths in parallel for faster computation.

In this example, let's create a 100x100 grid graph.

```rust
use bit_gossip::Graph;

// Initialize a builder with 10000 nodes
let mut builder = Graph::builder(10000);

// Connect the nodes
for y in 0..100u16 {
    for x in 0..100 {
        let node = y * 100 + x;

        if x < 99 {
            builder.connect(node, node + 1);
        }
        if y < 99 {
            builder.connect(node, node + 100);
        }
    }
}

// Build the graph
// This may take a few seconds
let graph = builder.build();

// Check the shortest path from 0 to 9900
// This is fast
let mut curr = 0;
let dest = 9900;

let mut hops = 0;

while curr != dest {
    let prev = curr;
    curr = graph.neighbor_to(curr, dest).unwrap();
    println!("{prev} -> {curr}");

    hops += 1;
    if curr == dest {
        println!("we've reached node '{dest}' in {hops} hops!");
        break;
    }
}
```

## Graph Types

- [Graph16], [Graph32], [Graph64], [Graph128]: Uses primitive data types for bit storage and are highly efficient.
  - In `GraphN`, N denotes the number of nodes that the graph can hold.
  - Use these types for fixed node sizes less than 128 nodes.

- [Graph]: Supports arbitrary node sizes and is optimized for parallel processing.
  - Enum of `SeqGraph` and `ParaGraph`. If environment supports multi-threading, `ParaGraph` is used; otherwise, `SeqGraph` is used.

- [SeqGraph]: Uses `Vec<u32>` or `Vec<u64>` to store bits depending on the target architecture,
  and generally about 3 times slower than primitive data types.
- [ParaGraph]: Uses `Vec<AtomicU32>` or `Vec<AtomicU64>` for bit storage, which is slower but benefits from parallel processing, making it more efficient as the number of nodes increases.

For fixed node sizes less than 128 nodes, prefer primitive-data-type-backed graph types.

The library exposes a generic `Graph` type that automatically selects the parallel or sequential version based on the environment, with manual selection also available.

## How It Works

### Graph Representation

<details>
  <summary>Click to expand</summary>

Each edge in the graph stores N bits of information, where N is the number of nodes in the graph.

In the edge `a->b`, `n`'th bit represents the presence of a shortest path from the node `a` to the node `n` in this edge.

Therefore, the graph can store all shortest paths between all pairs of nodes in the graph in NxM bits, where M is the number of edges in the graph.

Once the graph is built, you can retrieve the shortest path between any two nodes in near constant time, just by checking the bits in the edges.

</details>

### Building the Graph

<details>
  <summary>Click to expand</summary>

We will follow through a simple graph:

```
0 -- 1 -- 2
|    |
3 -- 4
|
5
```

At the start, all the bits in the edges are unset. Every edge will have bits `[ ][ ][ ][ ][ ][ ]` like so.

```
[ ][ ][ ][ ][ ][ ]  // 0 -> 1
[ ][ ][ ][ ][ ][ ]  // 0 -> 3
[ ][ ][ ][ ][ ][ ]  // 1 -> 2
[ ][ ][ ][ ][ ][ ]  // 1 -> 4
[ ][ ][ ][ ][ ][ ]  // 3 -> 4
[ ][ ][ ][ ][ ][ ]  // 3 -> 5
```

#### First Iteration

Let's start with node `0`.

For the edge `0->1`, we set the bits to `[ ][ ][ ][ ][1][ ]` since this edge is part of the shortest path to `1`.

```
[ ][ ][ ][ ][1][ ]  // 0 -> 1
```

For `0->3`, we set the bits to `[ ][ ][1][ ][ ][ ]` since this edge is part of the shortest path to `3`.

```
[ ][ ][1][ ][ ][ ]  // 0 -> 3
```

Next, we move to node `1`.

For the edge `1->0`, we can simply flip the bits of `0->1`.

```
[ ][ ][ ][ ][1][ ]  // 0 -> 1

flips to

[ ][ ][ ][ ][0][ ]  // 1 -> 0
```

We set the bit 0 to 1.

```
[ ][ ][ ][ ][0][1]  // 1 -> 0

flips to

[ ][ ][ ][ ][1][0]  // 0 -> 1
```

From node `1`'s perspective, the edge `1->0` is the shortest path to `0`, and gets further away from `1`. Makes sense, right?

Now, to `1->2`, we set the bit 2 to `1`, as this edge is the shortest path to node `2`.

```
[ ][ ][ ][1][ ][ ]  // 1 -> 2
```

Now, we move to node `2`.

For `2->1`, again, flipping `1->2`, we set the bit 1 to `1`.

```
[ ][ ][ ][0][1][ ]  // 2 -> 1
```

We repeat this process for rest of the nodes, which we end up with the following bits in edges, in matrix form:

```
[ ][ ][ ][ ][1][0]  // 0 -> 1
[ ][ ][1][ ][ ][0]  // 0 -> 3
[ ][ ][ ][1][0][ ]  // 1 -> 2
[ ][1][ ][ ][0][ ]  // 1 -> 4
[ ][1][0][ ][ ][ ]  // 3 -> 4
[1][ ][0][ ][ ][ ]  // 3 -> 5
```

Do you see a pattern here? Every edge has 2 bits set.

#### Second Iteration

Now, its edge will share its bits with its neighboring edges; this is why the algorithm is called `bit_gossip`.

**Note**: we share the bit only if the neighboring edge does not have the bit already set.

Let's start with edges of node `0`.

```
[ ][ ][ ][ ][1][0]  // 0 -> 1
[ ][ ][1][ ][ ][0]  // 0 -> 3
```

`0->1` is the shortest path to `1`, which means that all other edges from `0` are not the shortest paths to `1`.

So, we set all other neighboring edges' bit 1 to 0.

```
[ ][ ][ ][ ][1][0]  // 0 -> 1
[ ][ ][1][ ][0][0]  // 0 -> 3
```

Same with `0->3`. Since we know that `0->3` is the shortest path to `3`, all other neighboring edges cannot be the shortest paths to `3`.
So, we set all other neighboring edges' bit 3 to 0.

```
[ ][ ][0][ ][1][0]  // 0 -> 1
[ ][ ][1][ ][0][0]  // 0 -> 3
```

Now, let's go to edges of node `1`. I flipped the edge `0->1` to `1->0` for easier visualization.

**node 1:**

```
[ ][ ][1][ ][0][1]  // 1 -> 0
[ ][ ][ ][1][0][ ]  // 1 -> 2
[ ][1][ ][ ][0][ ]  // 1 -> 4
```

Since `1->0` is the shortest path to `0`, we set all neighboring edges bit 0 to `0`.

```
[ ][ ][1][ ][0][1]  // 1 -> 0
[ ][ ][ ][1][0][0]  // 1 -> 2
[ ][1][ ][ ][0][0]  // 1 -> 4
```

Since `1->2` is the shortest path to `2`, we set all neighboring edges bit 2 to `0`.

```
[ ][ ][1][0][0][1]  // 1 -> 0
[ ][ ][ ][1][0][0]  // 1 -> 2
[ ][1][ ][0][0][0]  // 1 -> 4
```

And same for `1->4`.

```
[ ][0][1][0][0][1]  // 1 -> 0
[ ][0][ ][1][0][0]  // 1 -> 2
[ ][1][ ][0][0][0]  // 1 -> 4
```

We repeat this process for rest of the nodes:

**node 3:**

```
[ ][ ][0][ ][1][1]  // 3 -> 0
[ ][1][0][ ][ ][ ]  // 3 -> 4
[1][ ][0][ ][ ][ ]  // 3 -> 5
```

becomes

```
[0][0][0][ ][1][1]  // 3 -> 0
[0][1][0][ ][ ][0]  // 3 -> 4
[1][0][0][ ][ ][0]  // 3 -> 5
```

**node 4:**

```
[ ][0][ ][1][1][1]  // 4 -> 1
[1][0][1][ ][ ][1]  // 4 -> 3
```

becomes

```
[ ][0][0][1][1][1]  // 4 -> 1
[1][0][1][ ][0][1]  // 4 -> 3
```

After the gossip session, the edge matrix looks like this:

```
[ ][1][0][1][1][0]  // 0 -> 1
[1][1][1][ ][0][0]  // 0 -> 3
[ ][0][ ][1][0][0]  // 1 -> 2
[ ][1][1][0][0][0]  // 1 -> 4
[0][1][0][ ][1][0]  // 3 -> 4
[1][0][0][ ][ ][0]  // 3 -> 5
```

See how shortest-paths information spreads like wildfire? just like gossiping!

Hence, the name `bit_gossip`.

We repeat this process until either:

1. all bits in all edges are set, or
2. no bits were set in the iteration.

That's it!

Since all operations are bitwise, the computation is extremely fast.

Also, "gossiping" at each node is independent from other nodes, so we can parallelize the computation, which we do in the `Graph` type.

</details>

### Path Retrieval

<details>
  <summary>Click to expand</summary>

After all iterations are done, the matrix will look like this:

```
0 -- 1 -- 2
|    |
3 -- 4
|
5
```

```
[0][1][0][1][1][0]  // 0 -> 1
[1][1][1][0][0][0]  // 0 -> 3
[0][0][0][1][0][0]  // 1 -> 2
[1][1][1][0][0][0]  // 1 -> 4
[0][1][0][0][1][0]  // 3 -> 4
[1][0][0][0][0][0]  // 3 -> 5
```

Now, how do we use this data to retrieve the shortest path between two nodes?

Let's say we want to find the shortest path between node `2` and node `5`.

1. Check the edges of `2` at bit `5`.

Flip `1->2` to view bits of `2->1`.

```
[1][1][1][0][1][1]  // 2 -> 1
```

We see that the bit 5 is set, so we move to node `1`.

2. Check the edges of `1` at bit `5`.

```
[1][0][1][0][0][1]  // 1 -> 0
[0][0][0][1][0][0]  // 1 -> 2
[1][1][1][0][0][0]  // 1 -> 4
```

We see that both `1->0` and `1->4` have bit 5 set; at this point, we can either move to `0` or `4`.
Both will give the equal shortest path.

Let's move to `4`.

```
[0][0][0][1][1][1]  // 4 -> 1
[1][0][1][1][0][1]  // 4 -> 3
```

We see that the bit 5 is set, so we move to node `3`.

3. Check the edges of `3` at bit `5`.

```
[0][0][0][1][1][1]  // 3 -> 0
[0][1][0][0][1][0]  // 3 -> 4
[1][0][0][0][0][0]  // 3 -> 5
```

We see that the bit 5 is set, so we move to node `5`.

4. We have reached node `5`.

The shortest path between node `2` and node `5` is `2 -> 1 -> 4 -> 3 -> 5`.

Hooraay!

You may think that this is a lot of work to find a path, but in reality, this is extremely fast.

In an actual game, we don't need to retrieve the entire path to the destination.

All we need is, "for the edges of the current node, which one is the shortest path to the destination node?"

After we go to the next node, we repeat the process.

If the destination is changed, again, we simply ask the question, "which neighbor should I go to next?"

## Benchmarks

The benchmarks below illustrate computation times for different graph sizes and types. They serve to highlight the performance characteristics of various graph representations rather than providing absolute metrics.

**Machine Specs:** Apple M3 Pro, 12-core CPU, 18GB RAM

The benchmarks were performed on tile grids where each node is connected to its four neighbors.

Here, `n` denotes the number of nodes, `e` the number of edges, and `(WxH)` the grid dimensions. For a grid of size `WxH`, there are `W*H` nodes and `2*W*H - W - H` edges.

### Memory Usage

Below are the theoretical memory requirements for different graph types based on the number of nodes.

The function for calculating edge bits' memory usage is `n * m / 8` bytes, where `n` is the number of bits of data type
and `m` is the number of edges.

The function for calculating nodes neighbors data memory usage is:

- For `GraphN`, `n * N / 8` bytes, where `N` is the number of bits of data type, and `n` is the number of nodes.
- For `SeqGraph` and `ParaGraph`, `e * 2 * 2` bytes for graph less than 65536 nodes using `u16` for nodeID,
  and `e * 4 * 2` for graph more than 65536 nodes using `u32` for nodeID where `e` is the number of edges.

The value in chart below is the sum of edge bits and node neighbors data memory usage.

It does not account for memory overhead of atomics, hashmap or vector structures.

So in reality, the memory usage will be much higher than the values shown below.

Below chart shows memory usage in bytes `B`.

## Features

- **parallel**: Enable parallelism using Rayon; this feature is enabled by default.

## Examples

I have made a simple maze game using [bevy](https://bevyengine.org/) to compare `bit_gossip` and `astar`.

The game will create a 80x80 grid maze.

You can move the "player" (green dot) using the arrow keys.

Whenever you press the `<space>` key spawns 200 more enemies (red dots) that chase the player.

When the player and enemies collide, the enemies are removed.

**note**: for `bit_gossip`, building a graph initially with 80x80 grid maze takes a few seconds,
and the enemies will not move until built. When built, it will log `graph built in ...s` to the console.

You can run the `bit_gossip` version with:

```sh
cargo run --release -p maze
```

You can run the `astar` version with:

```sh
cargo run --release -p astar_maze
```

This is just to show how `bit_gossip` can be used in a game.

For me, at around 1000 enemies, I start to notice a lag in the `astar` version whenever the player moves.
`bit_gossip` version, however, does not show any lag regardless of the number of enemies.

I went up to more than 20000 enemies, and it shows no degradation in performance.

Still, it is amazing how well `astar` performs even with 1000 enemies chasing the player.
This means that for most games, `astar` is more than enough.

you can change the size by
going into [examples/maze/src/main.rs](https://github.com/PoOnesNerfect/bit_gossip/blob/main/examples/maze/src/main.rs) for `bit_gossip` version,
and [examples/astar_maze/src/main.rs](https://github.com/PoOnesNerfect/bit_gossip/blob/main/examples/astar_maze/src/main.rs) for `astar` version.

Change the values in `MazePlugin::new(50, 50)` to change the maze grid width and height.

## Background

I am an avid day-dreamer. I am constantly thinking about solutions to problems, instead of
googling and finding out that the problem has already been solved 30 years ago.

My journey with _bit_gossip_ began with a quest for optimizing pathfinding in games like _Vampire Survivors_,
where numerous enemies chase a constantly moving player.
Traditional algorithms like A* and Dijkstra are effective for static destinations
but become costly with dynamic targets.

There are optimizations you can try, of course, such as:

1. grouping entities together and computing the shortest path for the group,
2. caching the shortest paths for a certain amount of time,
3. using a hierarchical pathfinding algorithm.

**1** seems hard to implement well,
**2** can be expensive in terms of memory and not worth it if the player is constantly moving around to different places, and
**3** actually sounds like a good idea, but at this point, I was already thinking about a different solution.

So, like any good game developer, instead of actually working on my game,
I started thinking about way of optimizing it.

I started thinking about precomputing paths.
This is an attractive approach since I can compute paths at game loading time, or even compile time,
and, after the game starts, shortest paths to player from any position can be fetched in constant time.

However, some concerns came to mind immediately:

1. It may take a very long time to compute all shortest paths between all pairs of nodes.
2. Storing all shortest paths may take up a lot of memory.

This eventually led me to explore bitwise storage of path information,
where each edge holds **n** bits indicating the presence of shortest paths through it.

**Note**

At time of implementing _bit_gossip_, I was not aware this idea had already been under research for decades.

The idea of asking 'which node should I go to next?' in gamedev is also not original at all.
Even back in 2003, Richard "superpig" Fine published an [article](https://archive.gamedev.net/archive/reference/articles/article1939.html)
that uses matrices to store the shortest paths between all pairs of nodes, although it does not give detail on how to actually compute the matrix.

I also later found out that there is an entire field of mathematics that is dedicated to solving this problem,
called _All-Pairs Shortest Paths (APSP)_ with sub-field for unweighted undirected graphs.

There are established algorithms that solve this problem such as Floyd-Warshall and Johnson's algorithm.

There are also many many academic papers on this topic that claim to have solved this problem in the smallest computational complexity.

I would like to know if my algorithm is already known in some form in the academic world; however, it has been pretty hard for me to find out.

Many of these papers are behind paywalls, and even when they are accessible, I find them very hard to understand, as I am not an academic.
When psuedo codes are less readable than actual code, I just lose all my interest in trying.

So, if you are an academic in this field, and you see that my implementation already exists in some form in some paper,
please let me know. If you could also explain it to me in simple terms, I will be very grateful.

Here are some papers that I found that are related to this topic, that I wish I could read:

- [On the All-Pairs-Shortest-Path Problem in Unweighted Undirected Graphs](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0022000085710781?via%3Dihub)
- [Scalable All-pairs Shortest Paths for Huge Graphs on Multi-GPU Clusters](https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3431379.3460651)
- [All-pairs shortest paths for unweighted undirected graphs in o(mn) time | Proceedings of the seventeenth annual ACM-SIAM symposium on Discrete algorithm](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.5555/1109557.1109614)

In terms of non-academic projects go, I do think that this project is unique in its approach.
At least I could not find any project that focuses on this specific problem that does not use Floyd-Warshall or Johnson's algorithm.
If you also find a project that is similar to _bit_gossip_, please let me know.

It's hard to find benchmarks for APSP algorithms, let alone any projects that implement them in actual code, not just in pseudo code.
From the very few benchmarks that I was able to find, _bit_gossip_ does seem to outperform them by a long shot.
If you also find benchmarks for other APSP implementations, please do let me know.
